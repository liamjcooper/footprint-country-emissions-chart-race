Clone this repo, then
```bash
cd backend && npm i
```

## Run backend
The backend runs on port 8000

*N.B. I changed the port from 5000 to 8000 as my Mac had a process already listening on port 5000 called controlcentre(?). Possibly something to do with AirPlay.*
```bash
npm start
```

To run test the backend needs to be running.
```
npm test
